1. Calculate Profit Margin

Write a function calculate_profit_margin(revenue, cost) that takes in the revenue and cost as arguments and returns the profit margin percentage.

Example: If revenue is 5000 and cost is 3500, the profit margin would be 30%.


2. Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)

Create a function calculate_clv(avg_purchase_value, purchase_frequency, customer_lifespan) that calculates the customer lifetime value based on the formula:
CLV = avg_purchase_value × purchase_frequency × customer_lifespan

Example: If the average purchase value is $100, frequency is 10, and customer lifespan is 5 years, the function should return $5000.


3. Sales Forecasting

Write a function sales_forecast(current_sales, growth_rate) that calculates the projected sales for the next year based on the current sales and the percentage growth rate.

Example: If current sales are $100,000 and the growth rate is 15%, the projected sales for the next year would be $115,000.


4. Employee Salary Calculation

Create a function calculate_salary(base_salary, bonus_percentage) that calculates the total annual salary of an employee, including a bonus. The function should return the total salary.

Example: If base salary is $50,000 and bonus percentage is 10%, the total salary would be $55,000.


5. Conversion Rate Calculation

Write a function conversion_rate(total_visitors, converted_visitors) that calculates the conversion rate for a business.

Example: If there are 200 visitors and 50 conversions, the conversion rate should be 25%.
